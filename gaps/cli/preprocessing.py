    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        Script config. This config will be updated such that the "cmd"
        key is always a list.
    cmd : str | list
        A single command represented as a string or a list of command
        strings to execute on a node. If the input is a list, each
        command string in the list will be executed on a separate node.
        For example, to run a python script, simply specify
        ::

            "cmd": "python my_script.py"

        This will run the python file "my_script.py" (in the project
        directory) on a single node.

        .. Important:: It is inefficient to run scripts that only use a
           single processor on HPC nodes for extended periods of time.
           Always make sure your long-running scripts use Python's
           multiprocessing library wherever possible to make the most
           use of shared HPC resources.

        To run multiple commands in parallel, supply them as a list:
        ::

            "cmd": [
                "python /path/to/my_script/py -a -out out_file.txt",
                "wget https://website.org/latest.zip"
            ]

        This input will run two commands (a python script with the
        specified arguments and a ``wget`` command to download a file
        from the web), each on their own node and in parallel as part of
        this pipeline step. Note that commands are always executed from
        the project directory.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Updated script config.

def preprocess_collect_config(
    config, project_dir, command_name, collect_pattern="PIPELINE"
):
    """Pre-process collection config.

    Specifically, the "collect_pattern" key is resolved into a list of
    2-tuples, where the first element in each tuple is a path to the
    collection output file, while the second element is the
    corresponding filepath-pattern representing the files to be
    collected into the output file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        Collection config. This config will be updated to include a
        "collect_pattern" key if it doesn't already have one. If the
        "collect_pattern" key exists, it can be a string, a collection,
        or a mapping with a `.items()` method.
    project_dir : path-like
        Path to project directory. This path is used to resolve the
        out filepath input from the user.
    command_name : str
        Name of the command being run. This is used to parse the
        pipeline status for output files if
        ``collect_pattern="PIPELINE"`` in the input `config`.
    collect_pattern : str | list | dict, optional
        Unix-style ``/filepath/pattern*.h5`` representing the files to
        be collected into a single output HDF5 file. If no output file
        path is specified (i.e. this input is a single pattern or a list
        of patterns), the output file path will be inferred from the
        pattern itself (specifically, the wildcard will be removed
        and the result will be the output file path). If a list of
        patterns is provided, each pattern will be collected into a
        separate output file. To specify the name of the output file(s),
        set this input to a dictionary where the keys are paths to the
        output file (including the filename itself; relative paths are
        allowed) and the values are patterns representing the files that
        should be collected into the output file. If running a collect
        job as part of a pipeline, this input can be set to
        ``"PIPELINE"``, which will parse the output of the previous step
        and generate the input file pattern and output file name
        automatically. By default, ``"PIPELINE"``.
